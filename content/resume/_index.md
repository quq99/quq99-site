# Experiences

*Intern*, <span style="float:right;">*July. 2017 - Nov. 2017*</span>

Basic Platform Data Mining Group, Yiducloud (Beijing) technology Ltd. (Startup) 

Project 1: ***Medical Records Scoring*** 

- Weighed up several models and applied GBDT model to learn artificial evaluation criteria, achieved AUC of 0.9 
- Utilized Spark to accelerate the training speed 
- Helped launch the product to dozens of IIIA hospitals to automatically generate evaluation results

Project 2: ***Template Learning*** 

- Performed a similar approach as tf-idf to evaluate the importance of each level of the node and its value(XPath) in 

  a CDA document 

- Provided the important XPath as the keys to assist colleagues in producing the semi-structured output 

# Projects

***Hair Dye***<span style="float:right;">*March. 2019 - May. 2019*</span>

* Responsible for the network implementation and part of data loader 
* Achieve F1 Score of 0.9 and IoU score of 0.817 on Figaro 1K dataset
* Deploy the network to android application

***SouthPark Chatbot***<span style="float:right;">*Oct. 2018 - Dec. 2018*</span>

- Used the persona-based Seq2Seq model. Designed and implemented the evaluation part
- Achieved BLEU score of 15 on average, 75 the best 
- The Chatbot can produce meaningful answers with personality, generate diverse responses to the same question and preserve a consistent personality during a conversation. 
- Git link: https://github.com/quq99/SouthPark-Chatbot 



***Opioid Addiction Crisis in Virginia***<span style="float:right;">*Oct. 2018 - Dec. 2018*</span>

- Used Isolation Forest algorithm to do anomaly detection in high dimension data 
- Manipulated K-Means algorithm to do clustering for data visualization in low dimension 
- Reduced the dimension of the input data by using PCA, improved the learning speed by 15%

***Agent Learning in OpenAI gym***<span style="float:right;">*Nov. 2016 - Dec. 2016*</span>

- Selected three environments in OpenAI gym: Acrobot-v1, CartPole-v0, pong 
- Implemented reinforcement learning algorithms including CEM, PG, DQN and tested them in OpenAI gym 
- Considered feature engineering to preprocess the input data, improved the learning speed twice 
- Applied the actor-critic method to improve the performance of PG algorithm, improved score to 5%
