# Experiences

*Intern*, <span style="float:right;">*July. 2017 - Nov. 2017*</span>

Basic Platform Data Mining Group, Yiducloud (Beijing) technology Ltd. (Startup) 

Project 1: ***Medical Records Scoring*** 

- Achieved AUC of 0.9 by applying GBDT model to learn artificial evaluation criteria  
- Utilized Spark to accelerate the training speed 
- Helped launch the product to dozens of IIIA hospitals for generating evaluation results automatically 

Project 2: ***Template Learning*** 

- Evaluated the weight of the nodes and its value(XPath) in the CDA documents by performing a similar approach as tf-idf  

- Used the important XPath as the keys to assist colleagues in producing the semi-structured output
